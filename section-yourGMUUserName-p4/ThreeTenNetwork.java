		//the DijkstraNode representation and trace it back to
		//"one hop" away from the starting node.
		
		//Example 1: startNode is host0, destination is host3,
		//if host3's parent is host2, and host2's parent
		//is host1, and host1's parent is host0, then the next
		//hop when sending from host0 to host3 is host1. So you
		//add the pair (host3,host1) to host0's routing table.
		
		//Example 2: startNode is host0, destination is host3,

		//directly to host3. So you add the pair (host3,host3)
